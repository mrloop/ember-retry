# ember-retry

[Ember](https://ember-cli.com) addon for exponetial backoff retries of a function.

```javascript
import retry from 'ember-retry/retry'

retry((resolve, reject)=>{
  let ws = new WebSocket('ws://myflakyhost.com');
  ws.onopen = ()=> resolve(ws);
  ws.onerror = (error)=> reject(error);
}).then((websocket)=>{
  //do something with websocket
});

retry(() => this.store.find('user', 353232)) //retry promise if it fails with error
.then((user)=>{
  //do something with user
});
```

By default will retry 5 times after 500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms, 4000ms, 16000ms.
The number of retries, initial delay before retries and the function used to calculate retry delay can all be configured.

```javascript
retry(() => this.store.find('user', 353232), 3, 1000) //retry 3 times at 1000ms, 2000ms, 4000ms
```

```javascript
retry(() => this.store.find('user', 353232)), 5,
  (retryIndex) => { return retryIndex+1*40; }); //retry 5 times at 40ms, 80ms, 120ms, 160ms, 200ms
```

## Installation

`ember install ember-retry`

## Running Tests

* `npm test` (Runs `ember try:testall` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)
* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

## Alternatives

_Why don't you use existing alternative instead e.g. ember-backoff?_
I wanted a cleaner way to retry a function where a promise wasn't returned.

* [ember-backoff](https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-backoff)
* [ember-concurrency](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency) like [this](http://blog.mrloop.com/javascript/ember/2016/04/12/retrying-functions-with-ember-concurrency.html)
